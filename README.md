I got tired of opening my phone to learn something and ending up watching random ahh videos. Built this so I actually learn something in my free time rather than scrolling off.

Perfect for micro-learning - just 5-10 minutes a day, but it actually sticks because you choose exactly what you want to learn about.

## What You Get

Choose your topics → get bite-sized knowledge cards every day:

- **Quick articles** - 3-5 minute reads on what you care about
- **Micro-questions** - Make you actually think about what you just learned
- **Resource recommendation** - books or courses to help dwelve deeper

Plus streaks that actually motivate you. All personalized to your interests.


## How It Works

Pick the topics you want to learn about → get personalized knowledge cards → build streaks that feel good.

The micro-learning approach means you're not committing to hour-long sessions. Just small, daily doses of knowledge that compound over time.

Questions help you think about what you read instead of just consuming content. It's learning that actually works with your schedule and attention span.
